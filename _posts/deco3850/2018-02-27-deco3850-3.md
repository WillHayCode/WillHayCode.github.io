Description:
With the rise of the internet came a rise of "Cringe Culture". Communities dedicated to posting content (photos, videos, text message conversations) deemed "Cringy". These are generally posted without consent and with the sole purpose of mockery. If this behaviour happened in the physical world, it would be immediately shot down as immature bullying, but because of the digital setting many people will happily write it off, tell the recipients to get thicker skin.

Enter **The Shame Cube**. The Shame Cube is my idea for a way to get people to engage with the idea of consent in digital media consumption. On the surface, it is a smaller version of one of the cringe communities I've described above, but with a major difference: the only content is willing given, and you must provide content of yourself to access others.

Taking the form of a locked box with a keypad, it is only after uploading embarrassing photos of themselves through their mobile devices that users are given a code to unlock The Shame Cube. Inside the cube is a small computer containing all of the photos uploaded by other users. Users can vote and comment, as well as see what is being said about their own photos.
