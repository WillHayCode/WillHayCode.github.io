It's 5 days until exhibit. On my todo list is

- Reading comments from Facebook
- Searching for people in Facebook Messenger
- Responding to friend requests
- Serial output from the phone
- Running headphones and serial output through the existing phone cable (with only four points of contact)
- Hooking up the Facebook scraper (with runs on Node JS) to the rest of the Framework (which is written in Python)
- Soldering the Twitter Tapper

And that's... pretty much it. I'm taking the phone home this weekend to work on it, and it should be fully functional in time for the exhibit but hoo boy howdy this is a terrifying time of semester
