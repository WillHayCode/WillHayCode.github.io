Week 2 is over! We laughed, we cried, we all gave 2 minute presentations. It was a good week.

My idea, *The Shame Cube*, was fairly well received. I was quite worried that it would be too "ordinary" compared to some of the more out there ideas, but the commentary on consent in digital media consumption seemed to have at least some of an impact on the audience.

I wish that I'd fleshed out some of the finer points, elements such as content moderation or external access, but the core premise of the Cube is something I wouldn't change. Maybe the name, actually. "The Shame Cube" is striking, but I think that "Pandora's Box" would have also been an interesting take on it.

My primary inspiration for the Cube is Pay With DATA's Bloon Interactive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrAWHz9hhqA. This idea captivated me, but it didn't sit right with me how... wholesome it was. I felt that it didn't have anything to say, or any reason for me to engage. Looking at the happy family photos of a stranger is all well and good, but it's not an experience I particularly relish. That's why I started looking for the content from strangers that people do engage with - Shame and Humour.

I'm very keen for next week and seeing the ball start rolling more, but this was a pretty good week.
